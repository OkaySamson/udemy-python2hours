# # Arithmetic Operator

# print (1+2)

# a = 10

# name = "sam"
# print ("hello" + "name")

# print (1-10)
# print (10*10)
# print (10/5)
# print (10/7)
# print (10%5)
# # % will show remainder
# print (10**2)
# #exponenent - to the power of 




#Comparison Operators
#response on bullion true false
# == asks if equal
print (10 == 10)
print ("abc" == "abc123")

# != asks if not equal
print (10!=20)

#greater than
print (10 > 20)

#less than
print (10 < 20)

# greater than or equal to
print (10>=20)

#less than or equal to 
print (10>=10)

#Assignment Operators 
# = is called assignment operator
phone = "duckphone"
a = 10 
a = a + 5

#can be done for all arithmetics
